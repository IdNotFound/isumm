		<h1>Welcome to Investment Summary</h1>
		Author: @danielfireman
		<p>This is a personal app created by Daniel Fireman to present a summary<br>
		of his investiments. The idea is to make super easy to have this app setup<br>
		so any person in the world can have a free, personal, data-locked,<br>
		investment summary web app</p>

		<p>Login to a google account is necessary and currently only Daniel Fireman<br>
		has access to this service (development purposes)<br>
		
		<p>Click <a href=/app>here</a> to access the app</p>
